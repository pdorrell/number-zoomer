This directory contains descriptions of issues in the application.

These are problems that seem to need fixing, but it is not immediately obvious
what the correct or best solution is.

No action should be taken to fix an issue without first:

* Analysing the issue
* Recommending possible solution or further investigation
* Confirmation of any changes

In some cases is may be worth creating a separate git branch or branches
to explore different possible  solutions.
